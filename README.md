# KJPFit
## _Project Description_
This project is a .NET Framework MVC 5 Web Application using n-tier architecture designed to allow users to create, view, update and delete data for a workout tracking system. This application is for anyone that wants to be able to create their own workouts and track other information. I chose this project because fitness is a passion of mine and I have a good friend that is starting his fitness company so I thought It would be cool to bring some of his visions to life. 
## _Installation_
Be sure to have the latest version of Visual Studio installed. From the main branch you will  be able to download the solution and open it.
## _Using the App_
Simply load the app and first register an account. From there you will create a profile. After you create a profile you can navigate the website!
